## Overview and Summary
Seasonal data from Oahu's weather patterns could help determine the prospects of sustaining a business, specifically in this case, a surf and ice cream shop.  
Weather patterns from June and December was collected over a period of time.  Overall, precipitation and temperature for June and December is relatively close.  
June gets an average temperature of 76.2°F, with a standard deviation of ± 3.42.  Precipitation between the two months in Hawaii is on average 0.166 ± 0.28 for June and December with 0.20 ± 3.42.  Simply, June is a bit warmer with less precipitation and December is a little cooler with slightly higher precipitaiton.  The average temperature for the stations throughout the year ranges from 70°F to 75°F.  

## Further analysis 
In addition to temperature, further analysis could be done on:
- Wind speed and the regularity of hurricanes  
- Precipitation and foot traffic-does rain actually prevent customers from stopping by the shop
